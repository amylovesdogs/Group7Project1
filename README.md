# Group7Project1

After initial discussion, it was decided to pursue Happiness and it's impact on public policy.
The dataset was initially the World Happiness Report, 2005-Present found on kaggle, merging in educational data from the OECD's Educational attainment - Adult
education level. 
Jackson was tasked with merging those datasets.
Amy would looks at trends for the top and bottom five.
Nels would look at the relationship between positive and negative affect.
Anisa would explore Life Ladder vs Life Expectancy.
Tony would juxtapose GDP and Confidence in government.

Amy was first with some major code looking at the trends. She generated a Top 5 and Bottom 5 graph for each year from 2005-2022.
Nels, Anisa and Tony later followed with their code.

Tony created the powerpoint presentation and incorporated all of the talking points and graphs provided by each memember.

On the day of the presentation, Jackson informed the group that he would not be participating nor contributing anything further; the educational 
aspect was then deleted. Additional analysis was added to both GDP/Gov and Trends.

The Final Analysis:
1. There is a strong correlation between Affect Difference and Happiness
Pearson Correlation Coefficient is .58: a strong positive correlation
With a p-value of 0.00, it appears that Happiness Score and Affect Difference are related.


3. Life Ladder and Life Expec
4. 
5. There is a weak and negative correlation between GDP and Confidence in Gov
In 2011: Pearson Correlation Coefficient is -0.25 : a very weak, negative correlation
With a p-value of 0.01, it appears that there is little to no reason to infer that the GDP is related to confidence in government

In 2021: 
Pearson Correlation Coefficient is -0.13 : a very weak, negative correlation
With a p-value of 0.17, it appears that there is little to no reason to infer that the GDP is related to confidence in government

7. Trends 1: Happiest tend to be in Scandinavia 
8. Trends 2: Least happy tend to be in Africa
9. Trends 3: Outliers from the above trends are likely due to political/social security or lack thereof.
