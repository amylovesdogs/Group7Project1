# Group7Project1

After initial discussion, it was decided to pursue Happiness and it's impact on public policy.
The dataset was initially the World Happiness Report, 2005-Present found on kaggle and merging in educational data from the OECD's Educational attainment - Adult education level. 
A group member was tasked with merging those datasets.
Another would look at trends for the top and bottom five.
Another would look at the relationship between positive and negative affect.
Another would explore Life Ladder vs Life Expectancy.
The final member would juxtapose GDP and Confidence in government.

Each member eventually contributed their code which was merged with the main branch.

Creation of the powerpoint presentation was a mutual effort,  incorporating all of the talking points and graphs provided by each memember.

On the day of the presentation, one member informed the group that they would not be participating nor contributing anything further; the educational 
aspect was then removed. Additional analysis was added to both GDP/Gov and Freedom to make life choices.

The Final Analysis:
1. There is a strong correlation between Affect Difference and Happiness
Pearson Correlation Coefficient is .58: a strong positive correlation
With a p-value of 0.00, it appears that Happiness Score and Affect Difference are related.

2. Life Ladder and Life Expectancy are stronly correlated.
 
3. There is a weak and negative correlation between GDP and Confidence in Gov
In 2011: Pearson Correlation Coefficient is -0.25 : a very weak, negative correlation
With a p-value of 0.01, it appears that there is little to no reason to infer that the GDP is related to confidence in government

In 2021: 
Pearson Correlation Coefficient is -0.13 : a very weak, negative correlation
With a p-value of 0.17, it appears that there is little to no reason to infer that the GDP is related to confidence in government

4. Freedom to make life choices and Happiess are strongly correlated with an r of 0.60.

5. Trends 1: Happiest tend to be in Scandinavia 
6. Trends 2: Least happy tend to be in Africa
7. Trends 3: Outliers from the above trends are likely due to political/social security or lack thereof.
